# AI Systems Exploration & Extension

> A hands-on exploration of modern AI system design, built with a focus on understanding, extension, and product-grade thinking.

---

## Overview

This repository is a **learning-by-building project** inspired by open-source work from experienced AI engineers and builders.

The objective is not to clone an existing solution, but to:
- Reconstruct core ideas from first principles
- Understand architectural and design trade-offs
- Extend the system with thoughtful improvements and experiments

Development is done using **Cursor** to enable fast iteration, reasoning over code, and structured experimentation.

---

## Goals

- Develop a deeper understanding of real-world AI system architectures  
- Explore patterns used in production-grade AI tools  
- Add meaningful extensions beyond the original reference implementation  
- Document insights for reuse in future projects  

---

## Motivation

Modern AI tools often abstract away critical system decisions such as:
- Context and state management
- Prompt orchestration
- Tool/function routing
- Reliability and failure handling

This project exists to **bridge the gap between using AI products and building AI systems**.

---

## Project Scope

Depending on the direction of experimentation, this repository may include:

- AI agent orchestration
- Prompt and context engineering
- Tool/function calling patterns
- Memory or state handling
- System abstractions for scalability
- Developer experience (DX) improvements

Each addition is intentional and documented.
